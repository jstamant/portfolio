# My Portfolio Website

Here's the repository for my personal portfolio website.

This website is a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I figured
this would be the best option for making a portfolio site, as using a platform
like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) would be overkill for making such a simple,
non-interactive site. The site also uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
as a CSS framework.

I could've used plain HTML with a CSS framework, but I went with Hugo to
separate the markdown from the content. ...Which is probably overkill for a
single-page site...

I'll be adding links and uploading screenshots once the site is published.
